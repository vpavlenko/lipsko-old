lipsko
======

lipsko is a Django-based web application which provides a pastebin-like service to prepare and share interlinear texts.  It's mainly designed for linguists and other people interested in foreign languages to help sharing glossed texts with colleagues and friends.

As for now, the application is being deployed to Heroku: http://lipsko.herokuapp.com/
